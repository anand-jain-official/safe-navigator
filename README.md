# safe-navigator
A safe navigation operator for javascript that allows you to access nested objects without throwing an error if you try to access the key of an undefined value. If you want to access obj.key1.key2.key3, you can import the package as safe and try safe(obj, "key1.key2.key3") and even if key1 does not contain a key called key2 and you try to access key3 in an undefined value of key2, the function will return the value of undefined without throwing an error.
